## FizzBuss 1 Loops

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For each number that is divisible by 5, "fizz" should be output and for each number that is divisible by 7, "buzz" should be output. If the number is divisible by both 7 and 5, "fizzbuzz" should be output. The modulo operator determines the rest of the division. Divisibility is thus easily achieved when the modulo operation (%, MOD) returns the remainder 0.
